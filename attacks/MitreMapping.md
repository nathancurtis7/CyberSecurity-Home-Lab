# MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

## Purpose
To map simulated attack techniques to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

## Scope
Focuses on techniques relevant to entry-level SOC and blue team roles.

## Environment
- Isolated lab network
- Linux attacker VM
- Windows/Linux targets

## Techniques Observed
- T1046 – Network Service Discovery
- T1110 – Brute Force

## Detection Opportunities
Mapped techniques to relevant logs and Splunk searches.

## Notes / Lessons Learned
MITRE mapping helped identify visibility gaps in logging.
